### Key Features in Action

**Dynamic Dashboard & Document Ingestion**

The dashboard provides a real-time overview of customer sentiment. Watch as a new document is uploaded, intelligently processed by the backend, and its contents are immediately reflected in the charts and recent feedback list via a reactive data-fetching hook.

**Conversational AI Assistant (RAG with Filtering)**

A full-featured chat interface allows users to interact with the RAG AI Assistant. The UI supports state persistence through `sessionStorage`, ensuring conversations are not lost during navigation. A dedicated filter allows for precise, targeted queries against uploaded documents.
